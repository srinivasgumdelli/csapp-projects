This is where I list stuff to remember, this includes important conversations and events.

```
KY: Hey Ed
    Got a question with to clubs and competitions

Ed: yes?

KY: If my club had to go out of state or country to participate in a competition
    - how do we arrange that, given that it is a small amount of people (4-8) for a competition

Ed: arrange that with your faculty advisor
    and then talk to ms damesek or ms weinwurm

KY: Alright
    Thanks Ed

As I said, here are the competitions that are available (to my knowledge) thus far.

**US Imagine Cup 2012, (Australia) spring http://www.imaginecup.com - Software Design, Game Design Xbox/Windows, Game Design: Phone, IT Challenge - I'm in this one, Game Windows/Xbox section.**

**National Stem Challenge, (Unknown) winter-spring http://www.stemchallenge.org - Game Design - I might join this one.**

**Meaningful Play 2012, (Michigan) end of school year - awards at October 2012 http://meaningfulplay.msu.edu/index.php - Serious or Fun Game Design**

**ThinkQuest 2012, (California) summer-spring http://www.thinkquest.org/competition - Website, Digital Media, Application/Game - This one requires a teacher to sign us up so you better be serious if you are planning to join this, I would have to ask Mr. DW or one of the CS teachers to do it and teachers don't like more work.**

**NYC BigApps 3.0, (New York City) winter, Oct to Jan http://2011.nycbigapps.com - Application - This is serious beans as we'll be competing against everyone, even people with Degrees. You must be 16 or older. - Patrick wants to join this because he thinks he's that good.**

**CHI 2012, (Texas) winter-spring http://chi2012.acm.org/index.shtml - Design, Game (Research is for undergrad and grad)**

Anyone can add to this list if they find something (IGF, for ex, would be on this list but the deadline's past). You should notify me as early as possible if you wish to participate in a competition. This is because I must request funding for the trips and inform teachers etc. etc.

Since there will likely be no funding (I'm guessing on thin air), you should be able to pay for this ticket. I think it's worth it though, since not even Robotics Team (Ha, take that) gets International Competitions and the opportunity to win so much money. The experience, ofc, is a reason in of itself.

Please, once you pick one, stick with your competition. You can participate in multiple, but don't drop out of a competition. Also, if you don't want to participate in a competition, that's fine too! Teaching/Learning CS and doing little side-projects will still be happening. I do encourage participation in competitions though, since as I said, you'll rarely get such an opportunity.

BTW: Our faculty adviser is Mr. DW. You will probably never see him at the club unless he is required there. This might change if you are in a competition and he is the assigned adviser. Otherwise, don't expect too much.
